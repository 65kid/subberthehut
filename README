subberthehut is a command-line based OpenSubtitles.org downloader, written in C.

It is inspired by subdl [1], which is not developed anymore.
The foremost reason I wrote this is because subdl only supports hash-based search.
subberthehut can also do a name-based search in case the hash-based searched returns no results.

Dependencies:
 - xmlrpc-c
 - glib2
 - zlib
 - bash-completion (make only)

AUR package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/subberthehut/
